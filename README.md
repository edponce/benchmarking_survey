# Benchmarking Survey

The current landscape of high-performance computing consists of many approaches
that depend on architectural capabilities, system/compiler configurations,
parallel schemes, etc. Each approach has different perspectives and techniques.
In this work we survey the current state of HPC, categorize the most common
approaches, and evaluate several kernels under different high-performance
regimes. Our study shows that there exist configuration and
application-specific parameters that can be leveraged to increase performance
further from current state-of-the-art implementations.

# Kernels

* GEMM
* FIR Filter
* SVM
* PCA
